Pre-compiled version
--------------------

Binaries can be found in Binary folder.

Or you can download it directly from official web-site: http://light-alloy.ru, but there you will find only the modern Light Alloy, not the classic one which is present here.

How to compile
--------------

To compile Light Alloy from source code you will need plain Borland Delphi 7 (compile with any other version is impossible), without any VLC/RTL customizations.

No custom components required.

Support
-------

Light Alloy v4.4 which is present here is latest Light Alloy version which DirectShow engine is written in Delphi (so named "classic" version). 

Current up-to-date Light Alloy version (which is v4.7, so named "modern" version) has video engine written in C++, and has a lot of internal rewrittes on UI-side (which is still in Delphi).

Thus, v4.4 is not in active development anymore, so only source code support is provided (feel free to email/skype me with your questions, or you can start a topic in Source Code board at Light Alloy forums).

What's the point?
-----------------

There are a lot of open source media players for Windows. But mostly all of them are written in C++, and there is just no any decent, robust, features-complete, and mostly bug-free media player written in Delphi released under open source.
